# Pocket-Pong
Pocket Pong (Pong for original Game Boy) by Boniato82. Using C language and GBDK.

Based on Ping-Pong Diplomacy by jduranmaster.

First of all I would like to thank jduranmaster for his code and effort. I'm not a developer, I just know a bit of C/C++, so I thought I could change/improve certain aspects of Ping-Pong Democracy with time and trying to understand source code.

Anyway, it's so sad that there wasn't an official pong game for original Game Boy (DMG, Pocket, Light), so this is my contribution, because I love Game Boy AND Pong game.

Here are the changes over original version:

What's CHANGED

    Inverted Colors, so now it's more similar to original arcade game.
    Changed Paddles and ball size (smaller and thinner now)
    Field of play now fills all gameboy screen (160x144).
    Score points now are on the field, change design of score numbers.
    CPU Paddle now only moves when PLAYER Paddle hits the ball (IMO it's better for gameplay)
    
What's ADDED

    Final score at the end of the game, based on Player & CPU points.
    Middle Net, like original Arcade game.
    PAUSE (press START Buttonn).
    CHANGE DIFFICULTY on game. Press SELECT.
    3 Speeds for your paddle: Normal (Press Up & Down) / SLOW (Up & Down + B button) / FAST (Up & Down + A Button) <- not yet :P
    Ball speed Increases over time. No boring gameplay! Just wait and It will be faster and faster.
